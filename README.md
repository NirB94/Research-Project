This research project serves as my alternative submission for the seminar assignment.

Project Submission for David Burstein's Lab at Tel-Aviv University

The primary objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the metagenomic environment of bacterial samples, based on their antibiotic-resistance data. The core aspect of this project involved:

Training a Random Forest algorithm to accurately model and predict the metagenomic environment.
Additional key aspects included:
Visualizing the frequencies of data points, categorized by various factors, such as the mechanism of antibiotic resistance.
Employing detailed visualizations to assess the model's evaluations and performance metrics.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you find this project insightful!

Enjoy!
